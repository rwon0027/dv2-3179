        <h1 class="center">Tobacco Taxes and Their Impact on Health</h1>
        <p class="center">Tobacco related deaths has and is still one of the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. Many countries worldwide
          have introduced higher taxes on tobacco products to help reduce smoking rates. How effective are these taxes in reducing deaths caused by
          tobacco use such as smoking?

        <p class="center">Tobacco taxes around the world vary depending on each country's policies. In many European countries and in Australia,
          taxes make up a significant amount of the price of cigarettes at around 70% or more in 2022. However, countries in Asia and Africa tend to have 
          a much lower percentage of tax on the price of cigarettes. The tax rates have been slowly increasing in the past few decades in many countries.

          <h2>Has increasing tax rates reduced smoking-related deaths?</h2>
          <p>From the chart on the left, we can see that the global smoking-related deaths has has been steadily increasing since the 80's.
             <br><br>Despite the increase in tobacco taxes, smoking-related deaths have continued to rise. <br><br>While taxes rising may have discouraged some
              smokers, the overall number of deaths has still increased due to population growth and other factors.

          <h2>How does Smoking-related deaths differ across Regions?</h2>
          <p>This chart compares smoking-related death rates (per 100k) across the world over the past few decades.
            Europe & Central Asia are consistently the highest in death rates, although they have been declining in recent years, followed by East Asia & Pacific. <br><br>
            However, regions such as South Asia however has shown a steady increase in death rates over time. This suggests that the increasing tax rate's impact may not be effective in all regions.<br><br>
            But does tobacco tax increasing actually translate into fewer smoking-related deaths?

          <h2>Do Higher Taxes actually Lower Smoking-related Deaths?</h2>
          <p>The below charts compare the top 10 countries of tobacco taxes (left) and smoking related deaths rates (right). Filters are below the charts to 
            see the top 10 or bottom 10 for each year.<br>
            We can see that countries that have a high tobacco tax rate don't usually appear in the highest death rates chart. Australia stands out as 
            a country with a fairly high tax rate but low death rate.
            This suggests that higher tax may be effective in reducing the number of smokers which results in lower smoking-related deaths. <br><br>
            However, there are several exceptions to this trend where countries such as Bulgaria have a very high death rate
            while having one of the highest tobacco tax rates worldwide. This asks the question of whether tax rates are enough to reduce deaths caused by smoking.
